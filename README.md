# Text Analysis from Websites

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to extract textual data articles from given URLs and perform text analysis to compute specific variables. The extracted data will be saved in text files, and the analysis results will be stored in a structured Excel file.

## Data Extraction
### Input

- Extract the article title and text from each URL.
- Save the extracted article in a text file with the format: `URL_ID.txt`.

### Data Analysis
For each extracted article, perform textual analysis and compute the following variables as defined in the "Text Analysis.docx" file:
1. POSITIVE SCORE
2. NEGATIVE SCORE
3. POLARITY SCORE
4. SUBJECTIVITY SCORE
5. AVG SENTENCE LENGTH
6. PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS
7. FOG INDEX
8. AVG NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE
9. COMPLEX WORD COUNT
10. WORD COUNT
11. SYLLABLE PER WORD
12. PERSONAL PRONOUNS
13. AVG WORD LENGTH

### Output Data Structure
Output variables should be arranged in the exact order as given in the "Output Data Structure.xlsx" file. The output structure includes:
1. All input variables in "Input.xlsx"
2. POSITIVE SCORE
3. NEGATIVE SCORE
4. POLARITY SCORE
5. SUBJECTIVITY SCORE
6. AVG SENTENCE LENGTH
7. PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS
8. FOG INDEX
9. AVG NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE
10. COMPLEX WORD COUNT
11. WORD COUNT
12. SYLLABLE PER WORD
13. PERSONAL PRONOUNS
14. AVG WORD LENGTH
